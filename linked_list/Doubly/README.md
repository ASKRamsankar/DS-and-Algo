## Doubly Linked List?
Each node in the Doubly linked list has two address spaces. One is to store previous node's address and another is to store next node's address. It has bidirectional links between nodes. So it makes travesing easier.
## Why Doubly?
In singly, we can traverse in unidirection. So once reached to end node we cant able to come to head if we doesn't use another pointer to mention head. It consumes time to. Doubly LL overcomes this problem.
## Applications of Doubly?
- Binary tree and BST implementation
- to store undo and redo operation while editing
- Dynamic and Bidirectional implementations
