# DataStructure and Algorithms
## what is Data Structure?
There are many ways to store data, element or object in programming. It gives some structure to the data. Each data structure has specific qualities and applications.
- Stack
- Queue
- Array
- Linked List
- Tree 
- Graph
These are the important data structures.
## why Data Structure?
I am asking you a same kinda question " Why any obeject in the real world has a structure ?". If you know the answer to this question that is also the same here. Data are stored in some  structured way to give the efficience while using. If a car has a good structure it will give best performance. If it has flat surface infront then it reduce the performance(speed).
## What is Algorithm?
It is a description or the slip you wrote to solve a problem. It is any method you used to solve a problem in programming. It also can be a solution for an addition problem. Efficiency of an algorithm can be found in, time that is used ot solve the problem ( BigO notation ) and space that taken to store the data. example, while searching, binary search(**O(log n)**) is better than linear search (**O(n)**) beacause of its time and space usage.
## why algorithm?
you have defined an algorithm to solve a problem and you know it is the best. It can't be better anymore. then only you can use the same while such case occures. If you does not know the algorithm for that problem, you cant use it again when required you should think and find the solution.
## why should be Algorithm learned with Datastructure?
There are many ways to solve a problem. you can use any datastructure for a problem. For each data structures, the algorithmn you gonna use is different. If you know the effective way of use the algorithm for a data structure it would better in solving problems. Eg. Consider Algorithm is an engine of a car, Data structure is the architecture  of the car. If and only if these works combined, we will get a good outcome from that. Than you think that..!!
