# Linked List
## What is Linked List?
In the name itself you come to know the meaning. In this the elements, data or objects are linked as a list. Each unit in the Linked list are called as nodes. Each node has a element, data or object and the address to the next node.
## Why Linked List?
It can grow dynamically. In stack, queue and arrays, elements are stored consecutively. In LL, data are stored in any place of the memory and the address only linked with the node. To make memory efficient programs. Any array implementation can be done with LL. You can implement stack and queue using LL. It will be more  efficient.
## Applications of Linked List?
- Graph Implementations
- Binary Tree and BST can be implemented
- Image viewer, Music player
